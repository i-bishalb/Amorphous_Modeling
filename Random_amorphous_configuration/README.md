This python code produces random amorphous configuration needed to start molecular dynamics (MD) calculation. The final file is in VASP input POSCAR format. All the atoms in the final configuration are separated by at least 1.8 Angstrom and the atoms satisfy periodic boundary conditions. The distance of separation can be changed by changing the value of "minimum" in the code. 

This code requires pymatgen installation. code python version: Python3.7
